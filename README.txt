Interactive Demo (December 6, 2019):

Project Name: Pizza Kid!

For the Interactive Demo of our project, please go to our GitHub
repository at https://github.com/Adontius/CPSC233-project/tree/master/src, or under GitHub user
Adontius/CPSC233-project.  

Download all classes in the src folder into a new folder, and then open them all in the Eclipse IDE. Select the "Run"
option in Eclipse on the PizzaKidGUI.java file. This will compile and run PizzaKidGUI.java and run our game in a new GUI window.

Instructions for gameplay will be provided in the game window. 

To test the main text class (PizzaKidText.java), run 'PizzaKidTextTest.java' as a JUnit test.
